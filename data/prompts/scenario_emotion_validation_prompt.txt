You will be presented with a narrative depicting a specific situation or event from someone's life. Your task is to discern the primary emotion or emotions that person might be experiencing based on the details.
Your response can include either one or two emotions, and should be selected from the five basic emotions in Ekman's classification: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness.
When answering, kindly specify your response(s) in lowercase letters, and separate them with commas if more than one emotion is identified. Be mindful to just provide the emotion(s) as a one- or two-word answer, without any additional information or commentary. Always align your deductions with the presented situation, and conjecture precisely the emotions inferred from it.
